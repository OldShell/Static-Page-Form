  <h1>Static Forms for small organisation</h1>
  <p>A half way house between a digitised paper system and a full blown Web Server with a Database and a backend to produce reports.</p>

 <h2>How to use the Forms</h2>
    <p>The forms take the place of MS Word and little else. First download all three sample documents and put them in a folder on your hard drive. Then open the 'Referrer's form by clicking 'Referrer', then click on the 'Browse...' button to open a file selection dialog box. Select 'Pippa's Template.xml'. This will fill in some of the fields in the form, saving the referrer some time. Put some text in the Client area of the form and save the document using the button at the bottom of the form. The modified document will go to your download folder and leave Pippa's template unchanged. Click the web browser's back button to go back to the Home Page. Now open the Engineers form and click the 'Browse...' button to load the document you just created or load the sample file, 'completed Referral.xml'.You should see that the referral and Client fields are complete, fill in the engineer's section and save the file as before. You can now do the same thing with the Administrator's form and open 'Completed by Engineer.xml. It is up to the user to manage the document as we currently manage the Word documents.</p>
    <h2>Why replace MS Word</h2>
    <p>Our current system uses MS Word documents with check boxes and text boxes for the user to complete, I would like to replace MS Word with a web form that you access via a web browser like Chrome. Everyone knows how to use a browser and most are familiar with filling out web forms. My forms have an unfamiliar option, they have a button to upload a data file and on submit a data file is downloaded. This is because there is no database behind the forms, instead its up to you to look after your data files in much the same way as you handle the current Word documents. Traditionally computers collect data using forms and display the data using reports, with this system the form doubles up as the report, displaying the data just as it was when it was collected.</p>
		<h2>Advantages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You don't have to have access to MS Word or be familiar with its operation.</li>
			<li>You can Create, Modify or Read a data file on a PC, a Tablet or a Smartphone.</li>
			<li>The data is in an open format, XML and it can be imported into programs like Excel for analysis.</li>
			<li>If the forms are not available, there is a fallback. The unformatted, data can be read with any browser or a program like TextEdit or Notepad. Hard going not be advised</li>
			<li>Data will not have to be entered twice as it is on the current Word Documents</li>
			<li>The file size is around One kilobyte as opposed to the current 100 kilobytes.</li>
		</ul>  
		<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Someone who is familiar with HTML and JavaScript is needed to maintain the Forms</li>
			<li>Not easy to make data files secure in the same way as MS document passwords</li>
			<li>You need to have access to the internet although the Forms, and 18 other support files, can be downloaded and run stand-alone if required.</li>
			<li>The simple XML Data Files can only include links to images, not the actual image data. Not actually true but true in practice</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Things I am working on and may be working, give it a try</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Add a link to Google maps so that directions can be printed. <a href="test1.html">Link to test snippet</a></li>
			<li>Make form dynamic so that the list of materials can be of any size. And tot up the costs. <a href="test2.html">Link to test snippet</a></li>
		</ul>
