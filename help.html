  <h1>Static Forms and Reports for small organisation</h1>

 <h2>How it works</h2>
	  <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/faeayk4fs1ixa0v/Form%20maintenance%20Draft%201.pdf?dl=0">A PDF file in Dropbox That describes how the system works, dipping on occasion down to code level</a>
	  </p>	  
 <h2>How to use the Forms</h2>
    <p>The forms take the place of MS Word and little else. First download all three sample documents and put them in a folder on your hard drive. Then open the 'Referrer's form by clicking 'Referrer', then click on the 'Browse...' button to open a file selection dialog box. Select 'Referral Template'. This will fill in some of the fields in the form, saving the referrer some time. Put some text in the Client area of the form and save the document using the button at the bottom of the form. The modified document will go to your download folder and leave Referral template unchanged. Click the web browser's back button to go back to the Home Page. Now open the Case form and click the 'Browse...' button to load the document you just created or load the sample file, 'completed Referral Report'.You should see that the referral and Client fields are complete, fill in the Admin section and save the file as before. You can now do the select 'Complete the case' and finish the case by completing the Engineer's section. It is up to the user to manage the document as we currently manage the Word documents.</p>
    <h2>Why replace MS Word</h2>
    <p>Our current system uses MS Word documents with check boxes and text boxes for the user to complete, I would like to replace MS Word with a web form that you access via a web browser like Chrome. Everyone knows how to use a browser and most are familiar with filling out web forms. My forms have an unfamiliar option, they have a button to upload a data file and a 'Create a Report' button to download data. This is because there is no database behind the forms, instead its up to you to look after your data files in much the same way as you handle the current Word documents. Traditionally computers collect data using forms and display the data using reports, with this system there is no database, the form generates the report directly.</p>
		<h2>Advantages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You don't have to have access to MS Word or be familiar with its operation.</li>
			<li>You can Create, Modify or Read a Report / Data file on a PC, a Tablet or a Smartphone.</li>
			<li>The data is in an open format, XML and it can be imported into programs like Excel for analysis.</li>
			<li>Data will not have to be entered twice as it is on the current Word Documents</li>
			
		</ul>  
		<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Someone who is familiar with HTML and JavaScript is needed to maintain the Forms</li>
			<li>The Report / Data file can only hold a brief discription of the solution. Instead it holds a link to the case folder</li>
		</ul>
